# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

## Description
This project is aimed at understanding and implementing hash tables in C. It covers various aspects such as hash functions, collision handling, and basic operations on hash tables.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding the concept of a hash function and its importance in hash tables.
- Implementing a hash table data structure and its associated operations.
- Dealing with collisions in hash tables.
- Analyzing the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables.
- Recognizing common use cases for hash tables.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No global variables should be used
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
- The C standard library is allowed to be used
- The prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `hash_tables.h`
- Header files should be include guarded

## Tasks Overview
- **0. hash_table_create**: Create a hash table.
- **1. djb2**: Implement the djb2 hash function.
- **2. key_index**: Get the index of a key in a hash table.
- **3. hash_table_set**: Add an element to the hash table.
- **4. hash_table_get**: Retrieve a value associated with a key from the hash table.
- **5. hash_table_print**: Print the contents of the hash table.
- **6. hash_table_delete**: Delete a hash table.

## Advanced Task
- **7. PHP Hash Tables**: Implement a sorted hash table similar to PHP's ordered hash tables.
